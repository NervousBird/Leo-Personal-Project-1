# Finance Website
This is a personal project that I am doing for multiple reasons. Firstly to build up my knowledge on databases, user logins, handling user information, etc. and also to be a useful tool for tracking finances, with more customisation than is usual. Especially since most apps and spread sheets focus on month to month (1st to 1st), where sometimes it's nice to have the ability to read things from a specific date mid month, depending on when you get paid.
